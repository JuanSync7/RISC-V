# ASIC Directory

## Overview
This directory contains files and configurations related to ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) implementation of the RISC-V processor. This includes synthesis scripts, timing constraints, physical design files, and ASIC-specific optimizations.

## Purpose
- ASIC synthesis and implementation flows
- Technology library configurations
- Timing and power constraints
- Physical design and layout files
- ASIC-specific verification and validation

## Contents
- Synthesis scripts and configurations
- Technology library files and mappings
- Timing constraint files (SDC)
- Physical design constraints
- ASIC implementation reports and logs

## Usage
This directory is used during the ASIC implementation phase of the RISC-V processor design. Files here are typically used with EDA tools for synthesis, place and route, and timing analysis.

## Dependencies
- RTL files from the `rtl/` directory
- Testbenches from the `tb/` directory
- Technology libraries (not included in repository)
