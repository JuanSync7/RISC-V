# RISC-V Core Master Project Plan

## 1. Overview

This document is the master plan for the development of the RISC-V core. It provides a high-level overview of the project phases and links to detailed, granular planning documents for each phase. The goal of this structure is to provide extreme clarity and detail while keeping the information organized and navigable.

This plan and all sub-plans must be followed meticulously to ensure a successful outcome. All code and documentation must adhere to the rules defined in the `.cursor/rules/` directory.

## 2. Project Phases

The project is divided into five major phases. Each phase builds upon the previous one, culminating in a complete, feature-rich, and verifiable System-on-a-Chip.

*   **[Phase 1: Foundational Infrastructure](./docs/implementation/PLAN_PHASE_1_INFRASTRUCTURE.md)**
    *   **Status:** `Not Started`
    *   **Objective:** Establish the core packages, interfaces, and module skeletons that form the foundation of the entire project. This phase is critical for enabling parallel development in later stages.

*   **[Phase 2: Single-Core In-Order Implementation](./docs/implementation/PLAN_PHASE_2_SINGLE_CORE.md)**
    *   **Status:** `Not Started`
    *   **Objective:** Build a complete, verifiable, and functional single-core RV32IM processor with an in-order pipeline. This serves as the baseline core.

*   **[Phase 3: Advanced Core Features](./docs/implementation/PLAN_PHASE_3_ADVANCED_FEATURES.md)**
    *   **Status:** `Not Started`
    *   **Objective:** Enhance the baseline core with advanced performance features, including a configurable branch predictor and an out-of-order execution engine.

*   **[Phase 4: Multi-Core System and Memory Hierarchy](./docs/implementation/PLAN_PHASE_4_MULTI_CORE.md)**
    *   **Status:** `Not Started`
    *   **Objective:** Scale the single-core design into a full multi-core system, complete with a multi-level cache hierarchy and a cache coherency protocol.

*   **[Phase 5: SoC Integration and System-Level Features](./docs/implementation/PLAN_PHASE_5_SOC.md)**
    *   **Status:** `Not Started`
    *   **Objective:** Integrate the multi-core system into a full System-on-a-Chip (SoC) by adding system-level components like a Power Management Unit (PMU) and a Bus Watchdog.

## 3. Execution Workflow

1.  A phase is selected for execution.
2.  The corresponding detailed plan document (e.g., `PLAN_PHASE_1_INFRASTRUCTURE.md`) is consulted for the specific tasks.
3.  Each task within the detailed plan is executed in the specified order.
4.  Upon completion of a task, the status in the detailed plan is updated.
5.  Once all tasks in a phase are complete, the status of that phase in this master plan is updated.

I will now proceed to create the detailed planning documents for each phase, starting with Phase 1.
