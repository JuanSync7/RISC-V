# RISC-V Multi-Core System Documentation

**Project:** RISC-V RV32IM Multi-Core Processor  
**Status:** üîÑ **DEVELOPMENT IN PROGRESS**  
**Last Updated:** 2025-07-05  
**Documentation Version:** 2.0 (Reorganized)

## üóÇÔ∏è Documentation Structure

This documentation has been reorganized for optimal navigation and reduced redundancy. The new structure provides:

-   **Consolidated Reports:** Key topics are summarized in single, authoritative documents.
-   **Directory-Specific Guides:** Detailed READMEs for each major code directory.
-   **Clear Navigation:** A central point to access all project documentation.
