# Advanced Feature Integrator Architecture

## 1. Overview

The `advanced_feature_integrator` module serves as a central coordination and integration controller for all advanced system features within the RISC-V RV32IM multi-core system. Its primary purpose is to ensure the proper integration, coordination, and monitoring of complex functionalities such as Out-of-Order (OoO) execution, Quality of Service (QoS), debug infrastructure, and various protocol switching mechanisms. This module is crucial for managing the interplay between these features, optimizing system performance, and maintaining overall system health.

## 2. Features

*   **Out-of-Order Pipeline Integration Refinement:** Coordinates components related to OoO execution (ROB, Reservation Stations) to ensure seamless operation and performance.
*   **QoS System-Wide Integration Validation:** Integrates and validates QoS policies across the entire system, including cache hierarchy and memory interfaces.
*   **Debug Infrastructure Completion:** Manages and provides unified access to the debug system.
*   **Advanced Feature Status Monitoring:** Continuously monitors the health and status of all integrated advanced features.
*   **Adaptive Control:** Dynamically adjusts system parameters (e.g., ROB throttling, dispatch policy, bandwidth limits) based on real-time system stress and feature health.

## 3. Internal Blocks

The `advanced_feature_integrator` module comprises the following key internal blocks:

### 3.1. OoO Coordinator

*   **Description:** This conceptual block (represented by logic within the module) is responsible for coordinating the various components of the out-of-order execution pipeline. It monitors the status of the Reorder Buffer (ROB) and Reservation Stations (RS) to identify potential bottlenecks or stalls.
*   **Functionality:** Based on `rob_full_i`, `rob_empty_i`, `rs_full_i`, and `dispatch_stall_i`, it determines if OoO throttling is needed and adjusts `rob_throttle_o` and `dispatch_policy_o` accordingly to optimize instruction flow and prevent pipeline bubbles or overloads.

### 3.2. QoS Integrator

*   **Description:** This conceptual block manages the integration of QoS policies throughout the system. It monitors memory bandwidth utilization and QoS violation counts to ensure that critical traffic receives the necessary priority and resources.
*   **Functionality:** Based on `bandwidth_util_i` and `qos_violations_i`, it determines if QoS intervention is needed. It can then adjust `bandwidth_limit_o` and `qos_priority_mask_o` to enforce QoS policies and mitigate violations.

### 3.3. Debug Controller

*   **Description:** This block manages the overall debug infrastructure, providing an interface for external debug requests and access to internal system states.
*   **Functionality:** It processes `debug_req_i`, `debug_addr_i`, and `debug_wdata_i` to read from or write to internal debug registers (`debug_registers_r`). It also provides `debug_rdata_o` and `debug_valid_o` for debug data output.

### 3.4. Feature Monitor

*   **Description:** This block continuously monitors the health and status of all advanced features. It calculates individual feature health scores and an overall system health score.
*   **Functionality:** It assesses the health of OoO, QoS, Debug, and Protocol features based on their respective input signals and internal states. It then computes `feature_health_score_o` and `integration_status_o` to provide a comprehensive view of the system's operational status.

## 6. State Machine (`integrator_fsm_cs`)

The `advanced_feature_integrator` module employs a Finite State Machine (FSM) to control the integration, monitoring, and optimization of advanced features. The FSM states are:

| State Name        | Encoding | Description                                                               |
| :---------------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `S_INIT`          | `3'b000` | System initialization. All subsystems are disabled during this phase.     |
| `S_FEATURE_SCAN`  | `3'b001` | Scans and identifies available features in the system.                    |
| `S_INTEGRATE`     | `3'b010` | Integrates and coordinates all available features. Enables OoO, QoS, and Debug systems. |
| `S_MONITOR`       | `3'b011` | Monitors the health and performance of integrated features. This is the primary operational state. |
| `S_OPTIMIZE`      | `3'b100` | Optimizes feature interactions when the system is under stress (e.g., high ROB full, QoS violations). |
| `S_DEBUG`         | `3'b101` | Handles external debug requests, providing access to internal debug registers. |

### 6.1. FSM Transitions

*   `S_INIT` -> `S_FEATURE_SCAN`: After a sufficient initialization period (`integration_counter_r > 100`).
*   `S_FEATURE_SCAN` -> `S_INTEGRATE`: Immediately after scanning features.
*   `S_INTEGRATE` -> `S_MONITOR`: When `all_features_healthy_c` is true, indicating successful integration of all features.
*   `S_MONITOR` -> `S_DEBUG`: When an external debug request (`debug_req_i`) is asserted.
*   `S_MONITOR` -> `S_OPTIMIZE`: When `system_under_stress_c` is true (e.g., ROB full, QoS violations).
*   `S_OPTIMIZE` -> `S_MONITOR`: When `system_under_stress_c` becomes false (system recovers from stress).
*   `S_DEBUG` -> `S_MONITOR`: When `debug_req_i` is de-asserted.
*   Any other state -> `S_INIT`: Default transition for unexpected states.

### 6.2. FSM Output Actions

*   **`S_INIT`:** `ooo_integration_en_o`, `qos_system_active_o`, `debug_system_ready_o` are all `0`.
*   **`S_INTEGRATE`:** `ooo_integration_en_o`, `qos_system_active_o`, `debug_system_ready_o` are all `1`.
*   **`S_MONITOR`:** `integration_complete_o` is set based on `all_features_healthy_c`.
*   **`S_DEBUG`:** `debug_valid_o` and `debug_rdata_o` are driven based on debug access.
*   **`S_OPTIMIZE`:** `integration_complete_o` remains `1` (features are still integrated, just being optimized).

## 7. Dependencies

*   `riscv_config_pkg`: Used for `DEFAULT_NUM_CORES`, `DEFAULT_ROB_SIZE`, `DEFAULT_QOS_LEVELS`, and `DEFAULT_DEBUG_CHANNELS` parameters.

## 8. Performance, Area, and Verification

*   **Performance:**
    *   **Critical Path:** Likely in the feature health score calculation and FSM transitions, as these involve combinational logic across multiple feature status signals.
    *   **Max Frequency:** 400MHz (ASIC target).
*   **Area:** Medium, due to the inclusion of feature monitoring logic, adaptive control registers, and debug registers.
*   **Verification Coverage:**
    *   **Code Coverage:** Target 100%.
    *   **Functional Coverage:** All feature integration scenarios, including stress conditions and adaptive responses.
    *   **Branch Coverage:** All conditional integration paths within the FSM and control logic.

## 9. Synthesis

*   **Target Technology:** ASIC
*   **Synthesis Tool:** Design Compiler
*   **Clock Domains:** 1 (`clk_i`)
*   **Constraints File:** `advanced_feature_integrator.sdc`

## 10. Testing

*   **Testbench:** `advanced_feature_integrator_tb.sv`
*   **Test Vectors:** 800+ integration scenarios, covering various combinations of feature health, stress conditions, and debug requests.
