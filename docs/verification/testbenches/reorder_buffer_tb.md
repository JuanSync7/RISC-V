**Source File(s):** `reorder_buffer_tb.sv`
**Author:** DesignAI
**Generated On:** 2025-07-05
**Module Type:** Testbench_Component

## 1. Overview

Testbench for the Reorder Buffer (ROB) module.
This section should explain the module's primary purpose (To verify the functional correctness of the ROB, including instruction entry, completion, retirement, and exception handling.), its role in the larger system (Unit test for the ROB, ensuring its standalone functionality before integration into an out-of-order core.), and what problem it solves (Ensures the ROB maintains program order for retirement, handles out-of-order completion, and correctly manages exceptions and flushes.).

## 2. Key Features

* Feature 1: Verification of instruction entry into ROB.
* Feature 2: Verification of out-of-order instruction completion.
* Feature 3: Verification of in-order instruction retirement.
* Feature 4: Handling of exceptions and ROB flush mechanism.
* Feature 5: Parameterized ROB size for flexible testing.

* `<AssertionName>`: <Description from tag>. (Type: <from `AI_TAG: ASSERTION_TYPE`>, Severity: <from `AI_TAG: ASSERTION_SEVERITY`>, Coverage Link: <from `AI_TAG: ASSERTION_COVERAGE_LINK`>)
* `a_axi_protocol_check`: Ensures AXI4-Lite protocol compliance on the slave interface. (Type: Formal/Simulation, Severity: Error)
* ... [TODO: User to list or point to relevant assertion files/sections if not tagged.]

## 14. Assumptions, Limitations, and Dependencies

* **Assumptions (from `AI_TAG: ASSUMPTION`):
  * Input `xyz_i` must be stable for at least N clock cycles after assertion.
* **Limitations (from `AI_TAG: LIMITATION`):
  * Maximum operating frequency is assumed to be X MHz with Y technology node. [TODO: User to verify/provide]
  * Throughput is limited by Z.
* **Dependencies (from `AI_TAG: DEPENDENCY`):
  * Relies on external `ClockGenerator_IP` for `clk_main_i`.
* **Performance Metrics (from `AI_TAG: PERFORMANCE_METRIC`):
  * Throughput: Target `1 Gpbs` when `P_DATA_WIDTH` is 64.

## 15. Synthesis Considerations

* **Target Technology:** [e.g., ASIC Xnm / FPGA Family Y. TODO: User to specify, may be hinted by `// TARGET_TECHNOLOGY_PREF` header]
* **Critical Paths:** [Known or anticipated critical timing paths. TODO: User to specify after initial synthesis. Hints from `AI_TAG: SYNTHESIS_NOTE`.]
* **Resource Usage:** [Expected LUTs, FFs, BRAMs (for FPGA) or gate count (for ASIC). TODO: User to update after synthesis. Hints from `AI_TAG: AREA_ESTIMATE_NOTES`.]
* **Special Constraints (SDC):** [Any non-default SDC constraints required for this module. Hints from `AI_TAG: SDC_CONSTRAINT_GUIDE`.]
* **Tool Specific Notes:** [Generated from `AI_TAG: SYNTH_TOOL_NOTE`.]

## 16. Verification Notes

* **Key Scenarios to Test (from `AI_TAG: VERIF_SCENARIO_KEY` and general knowledge):
    * Reset functionality.
    * Back-to-back transactions on all interfaces.
    * Empty/full conditions for internal FIFOs/buffers.
    * All modes of operation defined by parameters/control registers.
    * Error conditions and recovery (especially those defined by `AI_TAG: ERROR_CONDITION`).
    * Clock domain crossing stability (if applicable, based on `AI_TAG: CDC_STRATEGY`).
    * Low power state entry/exit and functionality in low power states.
    * Security mechanism validation (e.g., correct encryption/decryption, access control).
    * Safety mechanism activation and reporting (e.g., ECC error injection, redundancy checks).
* **Verification Strategies (from `AI_TAG: VERIF_STRATEGY`):
    * <e.g., Constrained random for normal operations, directed tests for error cases.>
* **Formal Verification Targets (from `AI_TAG: FORMAL_TARGET`):
    * <e.g., All AXI interface properties, FSM deadlock/livelock freedom.>
* **Emulation Targets (from `AI_TAG: EMULATION_TARGET`):
    * <e.g., System-level performance tests with realistic data streams.>
* **Coverage Goals:**
    * 100% statement/branch/condition/toggle coverage.
    * All FSM states and defined transitions.
    * Key functional scenarios covered by `covergroup`s. [TODO: User to point to specific covergroups.]
* **Relevant UVM Components (if applicable, from `AI_TAG: UVM_COMPONENT_LINK`):
    * Agent: `<ModuleName>_agent`
    * Sequence: `<ModuleName>_base_seq`, `error_injection_seq`
    * [TODO: User to provide details or link to verification plan.]
* **Security Verification Notes (from `AI_TAG: SECURITY_VERIF_NOTE`):
    * <e.g., Test unauthorized access attempts to secure registers.>
* **Safety Verification Notes (from `AI_TAG: SAFETY_VERIF_NOTE`):
    * <e.g., Verify fault detection and reporting mechanisms for all safety features.>
