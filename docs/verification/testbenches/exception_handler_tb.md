## 1. Overview

Testbench for the Exception Handler module.
This section should explain the module's primary purpose (To verify the functional correctness of the Exception Handler module in processing various exception types and updating CSRs.), its role in the larger system (Unit test for the Exception Handler, ensuring its standalone functionality before integration into the core.), and what problem it solves (Ensures the Exception Handler correctly saves context, updates CSRs (mepc, mcause, mstatus), and redirects program flow to the trap handler.).

## 2. Key Features

* Feature 1: Comprehensive testing of different exception types (e.g., illegal instruction, environment call, breakpoint).
* Feature 2: Verification of MEPC, MCAUSE, and MSTATUS CSR updates.
* Feature 3: Verification of program flow redirection to MTVEC.
* Feature 4: Handling of nested exceptions (basic).

## 3. Block Diagram
