**Version:** 1.0.0
**Source File(s):** `cache_coherency_tb.sv`
**Author:** DesignAI
**Generated On:** 2025-07-05
**Module Type:** Testbench_Component
**Target Technology Preference:** N/A (Simulation only)

## 1. Overview

Testbench for verifying MESI cache coherency protocol compliance.
This section should explain the module's primary purpose (To simulate multi-core memory accesses and ensure the MESI protocol correctly maintains data consistency across caches.), its role in the larger system (Integration test for the cache coherency controller and associated cache units.), and what problem it solves (Validates that shared data is correctly updated and invalidated across multiple caches, preventing stale data issues.).

## 2. Key Features

* Feature 1: Verification of MESI states (Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid).
* Feature 2: Testing of read/write hits and misses in different cache states.
* Feature 3: Simulation of cache-to-cache transfers and invalidation messages.
* Feature 4: Multi-core traffic generation for shared memory locations.
* Feature 5: Self-checking scoreboard to detect coherency violations.
