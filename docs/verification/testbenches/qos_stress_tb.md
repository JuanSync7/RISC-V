## 1. Overview

Comprehensive QoS stress testing testbench that validates QoS arbitration under high load conditions, priority inversion scenarios, starvation prevention, and bandwidth allocation fairness across multiple cores.
This section should explain the module's primary purpose (To verify the QoS arbiter's ability to manage and prioritize memory requests under various stress conditions, ensuring fairness and preventing starvation.), its role in the larger system (Top-level test for the QoS system, ensuring its robust operation within the memory hierarchy.), and what problem it solves (Validates that the QoS system correctly enforces priorities, prevents starvation of low-priority traffic, and allocates bandwidth according to configured weights.).

## 2. Key Features

* Feature 1: Tests QoS arbitration under high load conditions.
* Feature 2: Validates priority enforcement and starvation prevention.
* Feature 3: Tests bandwidth allocation and fairness mechanisms.
* Feature 4: Stress tests with bursty and sustained traffic patterns.
