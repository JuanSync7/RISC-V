## 1. Overview

Testbench for the CSR (Control and Status Register) File module.
This section should explain the module's primary purpose (To verify the functional correctness of the CSR File module, including read-write operations, address decoding, and access permissions.), its role in the larger system (Unit test for the CSR File, ensuring its standalone functionality before integration into the core.), and what problem it solves (Ensures the CSR File correctly handles reads and writes to control and status registers according to RISC-V specifications.).
