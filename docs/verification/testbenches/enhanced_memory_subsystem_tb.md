## 1. Overview

Comprehensive testbench for the enhanced memory subsystem, including multi-level caches, coherency, and QoS.
This section should explain the module's primary purpose (To verify the integrated functionality and performance of the entire memory hierarchy under various traffic patterns and stress conditions.), its role in the larger system (Top-level memory subsystem integration test, ensuring all components work together seamlessly.), and what problem it solves (Validates end-to-end memory operations, cache coherency across multiple cores, QoS enforcement, and overall memory system performance.).

## 2. Key Features

* Feature 1: Multi-level cache (L1, L2, L3) integration testing.
* Feature 2: Comprehensive cache coherency verification (MESI).
* Feature 3: QoS (Quality of Service) enforcement and prioritization.
* Feature 4: Multi-core memory traffic generation with diverse patterns.
* Feature 5: Performance monitoring and bottleneck identification.
* Feature 6: Error injection and recovery testing.

  * Throughput is limited by Z.
* **Dependencies (from `AI_TAG: DEPENDENCY`):
  * Relies on external `ClockGenerator_IP` for `clk_main_i`.
* **Performance Metrics (from `AI_TAG: PERFORMANCE_METRIC`):
  * Throughput: Target `1 Gpbs` when `P_DATA_WIDTH` is 64.

## 15. Synthesis Considerations

* **Target Technology:** [e.g., ASIC Xnm / FPGA Family Y. TODO: User to specify, may be hinted by `// TARGET_TECHNOLOGY_PREF` header]
* **Critical Paths:** [Known or anticipated critical timing paths. TODO: User to specify after initial synthesis. Hints from `AI_TAG: SYNTHESIS_NOTE`.]
* **Resource Usage:** [Expected LUTs, FFs, BRAMs (for FPGA) or gate count (for ASIC). TODO: User to update after synthesis. Hints from `AI_TAG: AREA_ESTIMATE_NOTES`.]
* **Special Constraints (SDC):** [Any non-default SDC constraints required for this module. Hints from `AI_TAG: SDC_CONSTRAINT_GUIDE`.]
* **Tool Specific Notes:** [Generated from `AI_TAG: SYNTH_TOOL_NOTE`.]

## 16. Verification Notes

* **Key Scenarios to Test (from `AI_TAG: VERIF_SCENARIO_KEY` and general knowledge):
    * Reset functionality.
    * Back-to-back transactions on all interfaces.
    * Empty/full conditions for internal FIFOs/buffers.
    * All modes of operation defined by parameters/control registers.
    * Error conditions and recovery (especially those defined by `AI_TAG: ERROR_CONDITION`).
    * Clock domain crossing stability (if applicable, based on `AI_TAG: CDC_STRATEGY`).
    * Low power state entry/exit and functionality in low power states.
    * Security mechanism validation (e.g., correct encryption/decryption, access control).
    * Safety mechanism activation and reporting (e.g., ECC error injection, redundancy checks).
* **Verification Strategies (from `AI_TAG: VERIF_STRATEGY`):
    * <e.g., Constrained random for normal operations, directed tests for error cases.>
* **Formal Verification Targets (from `AI_TAG: FORMAL_TARGET`):
    * <e.g., All AXI interface properties, FSM deadlock/livelock freedom.>
* **Emulation Targets (from `AI_TAG: EMULATION_TARGET`):
    * <e.g., System-level performance tests with realistic data streams.>
* **Coverage Goals:**
    * 100% statement/branch/condition/toggle coverage.
    * All FSM states and defined transitions.
    * Key functional scenarios covered by `covergroup`s. [TODO: User to point to specific covergroups.]
* **Relevant UVM Components (if applicable, from `AI_TAG: UVM_COMPONENT_LINK`):
    * Agent: `<ModuleName>_agent`
    * Sequence: `<ModuleName>_base_seq`, `error_injection_seq`
    * [TODO: User to provide details or link to verification plan.]
* **Security Verification Notes (from `AI_TAG: SECURITY_VERIF_NOTE`):
    * <e.g., Test unauthorized access attempts to secure registers.>
* **Safety Verification Notes (from `AI_TAG: SAFETY_VERIF_NOTE`):
    * <e.g., Verify fault detection and reporting mechanisms for all safety features.>
