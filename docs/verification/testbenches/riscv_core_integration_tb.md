## 13. Assertions

<Summary of key SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) used within or bound to the module, generated from `AI_TAG: ASSERTION`.>
* `p_reset_behavior`: Core should not be in reset when rst_n is high. (Type: N/A, Severity: N/A, Coverage Link: N/A)
* `p_memory_interface_valid`: Memory interfaces should be properly driven. (Type: N/A, Severity: N/A, Coverage Link: N/A)
* `p_debug_consistency`: Debug signals should be consistent. (Type: N/A, Severity: N/A, Coverage Link: N/A)

## 14. Assumptions, Limitations, and Dependencies

* **Assumptions (from `AI_TAG: ASSUMPTION`):
  * Input `xyz_i` must be stable for at least N clock cycles after assertion.
* **Limitations (from `AI_TAG: LIMITATION`):
  * Maximum operating frequency is assumed to be X MHz with Y technology node. [TODO: User to verify/provide]
  * Throughput is limited by Z.
* **Dependencies (from `AI_TAG: DEPENDENCY`):
  * Relies on external `ClockGenerator_IP` for `clk_main_i`.
* **Performance Metrics (from `AI_TAG: PERFORMANCE_METRIC`):
  * Throughput: Target `1 Gpbs` when `P_DATA_WIDTH` is 64.

## 15. Synthesis Considerations

* **Critical Paths:** [Known or anticipated critical timing paths. TODO: User to specify after initial synthesis. Hints from `AI_TAG: SYNTHESIS_NOTE`.]
* **Resource Usage:** [Expected LUTs, FFs, BRAMs (for FPGA) or gate count (for ASIC). TODO: User to update after synthesis. Hints from `AI_TAG: AREA_ESTIMATE_NOTES`.]
* **Special Constraints (SDC):** [Any non-default SDC constraints required for this module. Hints from `AI_TAG: SDC_CONSTRAINT_GUIDE`.]

    * Back-to-back transactions on all interfaces.
    * Empty/full conditions for internal FIFOs/buffers.
    * All modes of operation defined by parameters/control registers.
    * Error conditions and recovery (especially those defined by `AI_TAG: ERROR_CONDITION`).
