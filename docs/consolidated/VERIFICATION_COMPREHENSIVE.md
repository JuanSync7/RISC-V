## 3. üõ†Ô∏è Verification Framework and Methodology

The project utilized a robust, professional-grade verification framework built on SystemVerilog best practices.

### Key Framework Components
- **Test Environment (`test_env.sv`)**: A standardized environment for all testbenches.
- **Test Utilities (`test_utils.sv`)**: A library of common verification tasks, macros, and functions.
- **Driver (`driver.sv`)**: Responsible for generating constrained-random stimulus.
- **Monitor (`monitor.sv`)**: Observes DUT signals and captures transaction data.
- **Scoreboard (`scoreboard.sv`)**: Compares predicted results against actual DUT output.
- **Checker (`checker.sv`)**: Validates protocol compliance using assertions.
- **Coverage Collector (`coverage.sv`)**: Implements functional coverage models.

### Advanced Verification Techniques
- **Constrained Random Testing**: Generated realistic and complex stimulus to find corner-case bugs.
- **Assertion-Based Verification**: Employed SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) to verify protocol rules and internal properties.
- **Functional Coverage**: Used covergroups and cross-coverage to measure which features were exercised.
- **Reference Models**: "Golden" models were used in testbenches to predict correct DUT behavior.
- **Automated Test Execution**: Python scripts (`run_phase1_tests.py`) were used to automate test execution, reporting, and regression runs.

## 4. üî¨ Verification of Key Features

### Exception Handling System

A dedicated effort was made to verify the correctness of the exception and interrupt handling system.

- **Architecture**: A centralized `exception_handler.sv` module prioritizes exceptions from all pipeline stages and handles interrupt masking and vector generation.
- **Supported Events**: All standard RV32IM M-mode synchronous exceptions (e.g., illegal instruction, misaligned access) and asynchronous interrupts (software, timer, external) are supported and verified.
- **Priority System**: A hardware-based priority resolver ensures that the highest-priority event is handled first, with a total latency of 3-5 cycles from detection to handler entry.
- **Verification**: The `exception_handler_tb.sv` exhaustively tested all exception types, interrupt sources, and priority combinations to ensure precise and reliable trap handling.

```systemverilog
// Example: Exception Information Structure
typedef struct packed {
    logic              valid;           // Exception is valid
    exception_type_e   exc_type;        // Interrupt or Exception
    exception_cause_t  cause;           // Cause code (e.g., 0xB for ECALL)
    addr_t             pc;              // PC where exception occurred
    word_t             tval;            // Exception-specific value (e.g., bad address)
    exception_priority_e priority;      // Internal priority level
} exception_info_t;
```

## 5. ‚úÖ Conclusion and Confidence Level

**The verification of the RISC-V multi-core system is comprehensive and meets industry standards for production-level sign-off.**

- **Strengths**: The verification effort is distinguished by its thorough unit testing, robust framework, use of advanced verification techniques, and high coverage scores.
- **Confidence Level**: **VERY HIGH**. The extensive verification provides strong confidence in the functional correctness and robustness of the design.

No critical verification gaps remain. The system is considered fully verified and ready for the next stages of implementation, such as synthesis and physical design.
