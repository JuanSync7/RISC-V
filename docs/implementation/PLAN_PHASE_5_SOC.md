# Detailed Plan: Phase 5 - SoC Integration and System-Level Features

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Not Started

## 1. Objective

This phase focuses on integrating the multi-core system into a full System-on-a-Chip (SoC). This includes adding system-level components like a Power Management Unit (PMU) and a Bus Watchdog.

## 2. Task Breakdown

### Task 5.1: Implement Bus Watchdog

*   **Status:** `Not Started`
*   **Objective:** Implement a bus watchdog to monitor the system bus for hangs.
*   **File to be created:** `rtl/core/bus_watchdog.sv`
*   **Logic:**
    *   A counter that is reset by bus activity.
    *   If the counter expires, it will generate an interrupt or a system reset.
*   **Verification:**
    *   Test that the watchdog correctly identifies a bus hang.
    *   Test that the watchdog can be configured and disabled.

### Task 5.2: Implement Power Management Unit (PMU)

*   **Status:** `Not Started`
*   **Objective:** Implement a PMU to manage the power consumption of the core.
*   **File to be created:** `rtl/power/power_management_unit.sv`
*   **Logic:**
    *   Implement clock gating to reduce dynamic power consumption.
    *   Implement power gating to reduce leakage power.
    *   Implement dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS).
*   **Verification:**
    *   Test that the PMU correctly gates clocks and power domains.
    *   Test the DVFS functionality.

### Task 5.3: Full SoC Integration and Verification

*   **Status:** `Not Started`
*   **Objective:** Integrate the RISC-V core with other peripherals to create a full SoC.
*   **Files to be created:** `rtl/soc/riscv_soc.sv`
*   **Logic:**
    *   Instantiate the RISC-V core.
    *   Instantiate other peripherals (e.g., UART, SPI, I2C).
    *   Connect the components using a system bus (e.g., AXI).
*   **Verification:**
    *   Run a suite of system-level tests that exercise all the peripherals.
    *   Boot a full operating system on the simulated SoC.
