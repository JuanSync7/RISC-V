# Detailed Plan: Phase 3 - Advanced Core Features

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Not Started

## 1. Objective

This phase focuses on enhancing the baseline single-core processor with advanced performance features. This includes implementing a configurable branch predictor and a full out-of-order execution engine.

## 2. Task Breakdown

### Task 2.1: Implement Branch Predictor

*   **Status:** `Not Started`
*   **Objective:** Implement a configurable branch predictor to reduce the performance penalty of branches.
*   **File to be created:** `rtl/prediction/branch_predictor.sv`
*   **Parameters:** `BRANCH_PREDICTOR_TYPE`, `BTB_ENTRIES`, `BHT_ENTRIES`
*   **Logic:**
    *   Implement a Branch Target Buffer (BTB).
    *   Implement different prediction schemes based on `BRANCH_PREDICTOR_TYPE`:
        *   **Static:** Always predict not taken.
        *   **Gshare:** A simple dynamic predictor using a global history register and a pattern history table.
        *   **Tournament:** A more advanced predictor that combines two different prediction schemes.
*   **Verification:**
    *   Test each prediction scheme with a variety of branch-intensive code.
    *   Measure the performance improvement over the baseline core.

### Task 2.2: Implement Out-of-Order Engine

*   **Status:** `Not Started`
*   **Objective:** Implement an out-of-order execution engine to improve instruction-level parallelism.
*   **Files to be created:**
    *   `rtl/execution/ooo_engine.sv`
    *   `rtl/execution/reorder_buffer.sv`
    *   `rtl/execution/reservation_station.sv`
    *   `rtl/execution/register_renaming.sv`
*   **Logic:**
    *   **Register Renaming:** Implement a register alias table (RAT) to eliminate false data dependencies.
    *   **Reservation Station:** A buffer for instructions waiting for their operands to become available.
    *   **Reorder Buffer (ROB):** A buffer to ensure that instructions are committed in program order.
*   **Verification:**
    *   Test the out-of-order engine with a variety of instruction sequences that can benefit from out-of-order execution.
    *   Verify that the results are correct and that exceptions are handled precisely.
