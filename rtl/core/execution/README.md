# Execution Engine

## Overview
This directory contains SystemVerilog modules that implement the out-of-order execution engine for the RISC-V processor, including advanced execution features like register renaming, reservation stations, and reorder buffer.

## Purpose
- Implement out-of-order instruction execution
- Provide advanced execution optimization features
- Manage instruction scheduling and completion
- Support high-performance execution paradigms

## Contents

### Execution Engine Modules
- `multiple_execution_units.sv` - Multiple parallel execution unit manager
- `register_renaming.sv` - Register renaming logic for out-of-order execution
- `reorder_buffer.sv` - Instruction reorder buffer for in-order retirement
- `reservation_station.sv` - Instruction reservation and scheduling station

## Architecture Features

### Out-of-Order Execution
- **Instruction Issue**: Multiple instructions issued per cycle
- **Register Renaming**: Eliminate false dependencies
- **Reservation Stations**: Dynamic instruction scheduling
- **Reorder Buffer**: In-order instruction retirement

### Execution Units
- Multiple ALU units for parallel execution
- Dedicated multiply and divide units
- Branch execution units
- Load/store execution units

### Advanced Features
- **Speculative Execution**: Execute instructions before branches resolved
- **Instruction Level Parallelism**: Maximize concurrent execution
- **Dynamic Scheduling**: Runtime instruction optimization
- **Exception Handling**: Precise exception support in OoO context

## Data Flow
1. **Issue Stage**: Instructions dispatched to reservation stations
2. **Scheduling**: Ready instructions selected for execution
3. **Execution**: Parallel execution in multiple units
4. **Completion**: Results written to reorder buffer
5. **Retirement**: In-order commit to architectural state

## Performance Features
- High instruction throughput
- Reduced pipeline stalls
- Improved resource utilization
- Advanced branch prediction integration

## Dependencies
- Core control logic (`rtl/core/control/`)
- Functional units (`rtl/units/`)
- Pipeline interfaces (`rtl/shared/interfaces/`)
- Memory system integration
