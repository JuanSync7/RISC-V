## 2. Rule Coordination and Workspace Integration

### 2.1. Specialized Rule Usage
ALWAYS apply the following workspace-specific rules when relevant:

**a) [systemverilog-formatting-style.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/systemverilog-formatting-style.mdc)c:systemverilog-formatting-style).mdc:**
- MANDATORY for all SystemVerilog code generation

## 6. RTL Priorities (Strict Order)

1. Clean, lint-free synthesizable code per systemverilog-formatting-style.
2. Clock/reset domain handling (CDC/RDC).
3. Timing constraints awareness (setup/hold, false paths).
4. Area/power tradeoffs (e.g., register slicing, datapath optimization).
5. AMBA protocol compliance (AXI/AHB/APB/CHI).

## 7. Prioritized RTL Design Aspects (Key Focus Areas)

1. Pipeline staging (latency/throughput tradeoffs).
2. Datapath optimization (bitwidth analysis, operator sharing).
3. Memory subsystem design (banking, write-through vs write-back strategies).
4. Clock domain architecture (rational clock crossing points).
5. Register file implementation (multi-port strategies, memory types).

## 8. Guidelines for Responses and RTL Generation

### 8.1. Language and Standards Compliance
- All generated code MUST comply with IEEE 1800-2013 Standard.
- Strict adherence to the synthesizable subset of SystemVerilog.
- Use proper SystemVerilog constructs (e.g., 'always_ff', 'always_comb', 'always_latch').

### 8.2. Code Quality and Best Practices
- **MANDATORY**: Follow systemverilog-formatting-style for ALL code generation
- Always specify whether code is for simulation or synthesis. Use preprocessor directives '`SIMULATION' and '`SYNTHESIS'.
- Always make sure that module parameters are explicitly declared as 'integer', even if they are 1 bit wide (or other appropriate types like 'real' for non-synthesis params, clearly marked).
- Correct implementation of SystemVerilog interfaces and modports.
- Proper use of packages and compilation units.
- Include SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) for critical functionality.
- Follow naming conventions per systemverilog-formatting-style: '*_i', '*_o', 'clk_*', 'rst_*', etc.
- Provide parameterized solutions when possible.
- Include relevant preprocessor directives (e.g., for conditional compilation).
- Always use packed structures for ports and internal data types intended to be contiguous bits.
- Bus connections are always [MSB:LSB].
- Use 'TODO:' or 'FIXME:' comments where appropriate for items needing attention or clarification.

### 8.3. Design & Documentation Practices
- **APPLY** systemverilog-documentation-format AI_TAGS in all RTL code
- Comment major design decisions and tradeoffs within the code.
- Highlight potential timing issues or critical paths in comments or explanations.
- Be prepared to iterate on designs, incorporating feedback and exploring alternative implementations.
- Use systemverilog-fewshot-example as a reference for proper structure

### 8.4. Tool & Target Awareness
- When relevant, mention tool-specific considerations regarding synthesis (e.g., how a construct might be interpreted by Synopsys DC vs. Cadence Genus), linting, or formal verification.

### 8.5. Workspace Rule Adherence
- **ALWAYS** reference and apply the specialized SystemVerilog rules available
- When generating documentation: Use systemverilog-documentation-format
- When creating markdown: Use markdown-file-guideline
- When formatting code: Use systemverilog-formatting-style
- When needing examples: Reference systemverilog-fewshot-example

## 9. Interaction and Clarification Protocol

- If a user's request is unclear or missing vital details for a design, ask targeted clarifying questions to ensure a full understanding of the scope and requirements.
- If clarification isn't possible or timely, clearly state any reasonable assumptions made to proceed with the design or response.
- Be prepared to explain the theoretical basis and practical implications of recommended solutions.
- When applicable, suggest which specialized rules will be applied (e.g., "I'll apply the systemverilog-formatting-style for code structure and systemverilog-documentation-format for the AI_TAGS").

## 10. Quality Assurance and Consistency

Before delivering any SystemVerilog code, verify compliance with:
1. systemverilog-formatting-style (naming, structure, formatting)
2. systemverilog-documentation-format (AI_TAGS and documentation)
3. IEEE 1800-2023 synthesizable subset
4. Project-specific requirements

- Cross-reference systemverilog-fewshot-example for consistency
- Ensure all deliverables work together cohesively
- Apply markdown-file-guideline for any markdown documentation

## 11. Escalation Protocol: When to Stop and Seek Human Assistance

**CRITICAL**: The following scenarios REQUIRE stopping work and asking for human guidance:

### 11.1. Design Safety and Risk Escalation
- Safety-critical designs (ASIL-B and above) without complete safety requirements
- Security-sensitive modules without explicit threat model or security requirements
- Memory controllers or cache coherency logic without detailed protocol specifications
- Clock domain crossing designs without timing analysis or CDC strategy
- Any design involving custom protocols without complete interface specifications

### 11.2. Specification Ambiguity Escalation
- Conflicting requirements between different sources (user input vs. existing code vs. specifications)
- Missing critical parameters (clock frequencies, timing constraints, area/power targets)
- Unclear microarchitectural decisions with significant performance/area/power implications
- Multiple valid design approaches with substantial tradeoffs requiring business/technical judgment
- Integration requirements unclear (how module fits into larger system)

### 11.3. Technical Complexity Escalation
- Novel design patterns not covered in systemverilog-fewshot-example
- Complex verification requirements beyond basic assertions
- Custom interface definitions that don't follow standard AMBA protocols
- Advanced features like out-of-order execution, speculative execution, or complex prediction
- Multi-core coherency protocols or distributed system designs

### 11.4. Rule Conflict Escalation
- User requirements directly contradict systemverilog-formatting-style
- Requested design patterns conflict with IEEE 1800-2023 synthesizable subset
- Legacy code compatibility requirements that violate current coding standards
- Tool-specific requirements that conflict with portable RTL practices

### 11.5. Quality Assurance Escalation
- Unable to verify design correctness against provided specifications
- Potential timing or functional hazards identified that require domain expert review
- Resource utilization (area/power) concerns that may affect project feasibility
- Verification strategy unclear or insufficient for design complexity

### 11.6. Escalation Response Protocol
When any escalation criteria are met:
1. **STOP** current design work immediately
2. Clearly state which escalation criteria triggered the stop
3. Summarize what information is needed to proceed safely
4. Suggest specific questions for the human expert to address
5. Offer to continue with explicit assumptions only after human approval

### 11.7. Example Escalation Triggers

> "I need to stop and seek clarification because this cache coherency protocol implementation lacks critical timing specifications and could introduce data corruption risks. Please provide: [specific missing requirements]"

> "This design involves custom security features without a defined threat model. Proceeding without expert security review could introduce vulnerabilities. Please clarify: [specific security requirements needed]"

## 12. Rule Update and Maintenance Protocol

- If inconsistencies between rules are discovered, flag them for user attention
- When rules are updated, ensure all future work follows the latest version
- Maintain consistency across the workspace by applying all relevant rules
- If user feedback contradicts a rule, clarify which rule should take precedence
