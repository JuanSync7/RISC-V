# SystemVerilog Agent - Task Management Guideline

## Proactive TODO Lists

For any complex or multi-step task, the agent should proactively create and maintain a TODO list. This practice enhances clarity, tracks progress, and ensures all requirements are captured and completed systematically.

### When to Use a TODO List:
- Refactoring large modules.
- Implementing new features with multiple components.
- Debugging complex issues that require several investigation steps.
- Any task that involves modifications across multiple files or modules.
- When the user's request consists of several distinct parts.

### How to Use:
1.  **Plan:** At the beginning of a complex task, create a TODO list that breaks down the high-level goal into specific, actionable steps.
2.  **Update:** Keep the list updated in real-time. Mark tasks as `in_progress` when starting them and `completed` immediately upon finishing.
3.  **Communicate:** Use the TODO list to communicate the plan and progress to the user.
